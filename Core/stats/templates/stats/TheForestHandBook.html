	<h2><strong>-Introduction-</strong></h2>
	<h4>Welcome to the forest. you are a WW1 Tank squadron who is about to enter an inter-dimensional rift known as 'The Forest'. This game is designed to solve problems with creativity. instead of a hard list of what you can and can't do. Actions are described by the player and left up the Game Commander's (Game master) discretion. A player may attempt to do anything they can think of within reason. If something is impossible the GC may simply inform them they cannot try that. but anything that seems reasonable should be allowed. The player will roll and it will determine if the player achieved their goal.</h4>

		<h3><strong>Power</strong>:</h3>
			<p>&emsp; This would be used for any kind of magic stat or super power. each spell/spell group or power would have a unique ability mode per player. (Could be used for curtain hidden abilities) this stat can grow as the player learns how to use it. for example if a player learns fireball it would start +0 but after a while as they use it a lot it would become +1 and so on</p>

	<h2><strong>-Surges and Moments-</strong></h2>
	<h4>This game has a special way of dealing with critical successes and critical failures. They are called: "<strong>Action Surges</strong>" and "<strong>Moments of Weakness</strong>".</h4>
	
	<h4>When a player rolls a natural 20 they gain an <strong>Action Surge</strong>. An <strong>Action Surges</strong> is a currency that may only be used <b>Outside of combat</b> to avoid rolling. Action surges max out at 5. You may use 1 surge for a ten or 3 Surges for a twenty. 4 players may also use up 1 action surge each to perform a &ldquo;<strong>Team Surge</strong>&rdquo; all 4 players roll and the highest roll is used for the action.</h4>
	
	<h4>When a player rolls a natural 1 they have the opportunity to take a <strong>moment of weakness</strong>. If they choose to take it then, the roll is considered a critical success with unexpected side effects. These side effects are up to the GC, but shouldn't be too cruel. If they player chooses not to take the <strong>moment of weakness</strong> they gain a <strong>Moment of strength</strong> A player may spend 5 <strong>moments of strength</strong> to change ANY roll to a critical. This can be done after the roll and <b>includes combat rolls.</b> Moments of strength max out at 10.</h4>
	
	<h4><strong>Wild Roll:</strong> Wild rolls can be used whenever the GC wants something random to occur. a player of their choice or the entire group rolls a d20 with no modifier and the GC determines based on the roll. they can also use the following to determine if the random event it favorable or not: 1-5 = bad 6-14 = neutral, 15-20 = good. or 1-10 = bad 11-20 = good. it is up to the GC's choice. for group roles the GC can count total goods vs bad to see overall how the group did. some examples of a wild roll: player: 'Does the room have any ammo?' GC 'make a wild roll' if the player rolls good it does, if they roll bad it doesn't. another example. 'and NPC approaches make a wild roll' if the player roll bad its is a villain but if they roll good it is a helpful NPC.</h4>

	<section id = 'grade'><div class = well>
		<h2><strong>-Grade system-</strong></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Players are given a starting 'Grade' in the following classes:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Written Exams (MIND)</p>
		<p>Combat Range (FIST)</p>
		<p>Field Exercises (EYES)</p>
		<p>Group Tasks (FACE)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>(grades MUST average a C (score wise NOT modifier wise))</p>
		<p>Letter : Stat Modifier : score</p>
		<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
		<p>A : +4 : 5</p>
		<p>B : +2 : 4</p>
		<p>C : +1 : 3</p>
		<p>D : 0  : 2</p>
		<p>E : -2 : 1</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Players can choose to get really good grades in some categories and crap grades in other. OR they can spend them evenly to be a more rounded but less specialized soldier.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Example grades:</p>
		<p>AAEE -&gt; average(5,5,1,1) = 3</p>
		<p>CCCC -&gt; average(3,3,3,3) = 3</p>
		<p>ACDD -&gt; average(5,3,2,2) = 3</p>
		<p>BCCD -&gt; average(4,3,3,2) = 3</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>These modifiers can be altered after the game starts. the grade system is only a jumping off point. through leveling or rewards a player could get there -2 to 0 or there +4 to a +6. etc. (Max +6 after level up)</p>

		<h2><strong>-Magic-</strong></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>While adventuring in the forest soldiers may learn magical abilities. when casting a spell the soldier will usually roll a mind score to see it it succeeds. (the GC may make exceptions). offensive spells would follow similar logic to making an attack. for upkeep spells the soldier must sacrifice an action each turn for each unique spell they're up keeping. they cannot upkeep more spells than they have actions unless they have a specific reason in-game, such as a charm that grants free upkeep on X number of spells. In addition to the mind score spells have specific rules and generally fall into one of three categories below: Physical, Spiritual, Mental.</h4>
		<div class = well><h2>Physical Magic:</h2>
		<h3>Physical magic is a broad category for all the magic that effects the physical world.</h3>
		<h4>Physical Magic has 3 basic components:</h4>
		<h4><ol>
			<li>structure </li>
			<li>composition</li>
			<li>behavior</li>
		</ol></h4>
		<h4>Each component has a cost, when the player casts the spell the highest cost is used. for example if a player wants to cast a fireball. Structure = ball(cost 1 action). composition = fire (cost 1 action). behavior = projectile (cost 2 actions). the over all cost is 2, because projectile costs 2.) if the player wishes to combine anything lets say for example they want to combine fire with earth to make lava. Then the composition costs are added together. so it would end up costing fire (1) + earth (1) = 2 action points. A player may choose to spend more then one round if they do not have enough action points that turn.</h4>
		<h4>Examples:</h4>
		<h3>Structure</h3>
		<h4>
			<li>Wall (cost 1)</li>
			<li>ball (cost 1)</li>
			<li>weapon (cost 2)</li>
			<li>armour (cost 2)</li>
		</h4>
		<h3>composition</h3>
		<h4>
			<li>fire (cost 1)</li>
			<li>Earth (cost 1)</li>
			<li>water (cost 1)</li>
			<li>Air (cost 1)</li>
			<li>divine Light (cost 2)</li>
			<li>Darkness (cost 2)</li>
			<li>organic matter (cost 3)</li>
		</h4>
		<h3>behavior</h3>
		<h4>
			<li>do nothing (cost 0)</li>
			<li>resist change (cost 1)</li>
			<li>Projectile (cost 2)</li>
			<li>Identify foe (cost 3)</li>
			<li>Identify friend (cost 3)</li>
			<li> combine with target (cost 3)</li>
		</h4></div>
		<div class = well><h2>Spiritual Magic:</h2>
		<h3>Spiritual magic effects things like the souls, life energy, and emotions.</h3>
		<h4>Spiritual Spells have 2 basic components:</h4>
		<h4><ol>
			<li>Sacrifice</li>
			<li>Effect</li>
		</ol></h4>
		<h4>When casting a Spiritual spell the player first pays the cost then casts. for example if a player wants to cause fear in their enemies the cost may be a blood sacrifice. the player rolls a die based on the difficulty of the spell and takes that much damage -2. so for example a d4 can deal a max of 2 damage.  and takes that much damage. The blood sacrifice has no effect on the success of the spell. A player my also choose to gain negative max health as a sacrifice instead of making a blood sacrifice roll for upkeep spells. It is up to the GC what sacrifices can be used. This would usually be [number of upkeep spiritual spells] * [spell difficulty]. so harder spells require more blood.</h4>
		<h4>Examples:</h4>
		<h3>Sacrifice</h3>
		<h4>
			<li>Blood Sacrifice roll</li>
			<li>Temporary lower max life</li>
			<li>Temporary Stat reduction</li>
		</h4>
		<h3>Effect</h3>
		<h4>
			<li>Reanimate dead</li>
			<li>Manipulate target emotions</li>
			<li>drain target's life</li>

		<h2><strong>-Unique Powers-</strong></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>In addition to magic soldiers my also learn unique powers while adventuring in the forest. These abilities are usually more powerful than regular magic or skills. It is up to the GC what kind of powers the players can get. Unlike magic, these powers should be generally vague and not super specific. for example instead of saying the player can now 'summon a fireball that requires 15 or better and deals 5 damage' the power could be 'player may summon and control fire' this then allows the players to solve various problems with their fire ability, not just use it as an attack. they may start a campfire for warmth or illuminate a dark space. when they player uses the power they roll a d20 + the power score. difficult things should require a higher roll and is left up to the GC. for example if you wanted to throw a fire ball, it would likely be only as difficult as a basic attack. but if you wanted to spread a wave of fire across several enemies this would defiantly require a higher roll such as a 19 or better. Power Value can increase making hard rolls easier for the player.</h4>

		<h4>Each player will be able to choose one or several hidden talents depending on size. the GC should work with the player to give them something that makes them special but also is balanced with others and doesn&rsquo;t break the game. These hidden talents offer special skills or items and do not need to be revealed player to player.</h4>

		<h2><strong>-Combat-</strong></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>At the beginning of Combat everyone rolls eye stat to determine Combat order. Generally, Enemy soldiers will have a 10 (special enemies may go earlier or later based on GC discretion). The idea being: players who roll well go first, then enemies, then players who roll poorly. If all players roll higher than 10, then all players go first.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Actions:</h3>
		<p>Each player-soldier has 3 action points and 1 break points per rotation. During his turn he can spend the actions on things such as movement or attacking. The exact nature of what they are doing determines the amount of action points they need to spend (as decided by the GC). For example: they can move a normal distance in 1 or they can sprint much further by spending all 3 action points.</p>
		<p>For movement during combat they may spend 1 action to move 30 units</p>	
		<p>During any turn if a player is about to be effected by an action they can spend there breakpoints to react to the action. this could be dodging an explosion. or taking a shot at someone attempting to run past them. It is important that the player is somehow effected by the action to allow them to take a break point.</p>
		<p>Ties go to the defender if they are in cover otherwise they go to the attacker.</p>
		<p>Guard, a player may choose to guard a zone for 1 action. This allows them to use their reaction to attack anyone that enters the zone.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h3>Shooting:</h3>
		<p>see: <a href = "#shooting"> Shooting Combat </a></p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Melee:</h3>
		<p>When a player makes a melee attack, they roll fist based on the level of the attack. If it fails by more than 5 the enemy soldier makes a counter melee attack to defend.</P>
		<h4>1: Light</h4>
		<p>Does a small amoung of damage.</p>
		<pre>[To hit <a href = "#fist">Fist</a> roll of 12 or greater]</pre>
		<h4>2: Medium</h4>
		<p>Does a fair amount of damage. capable of half-healthing some enemies.</p>
		<pre>[To hit <a href = "#fist">Fist</a> roll of 15 or greater]</pre>
		<h4>3: Heavy</h4>
		<p>Does a alot of damage. Capable of killing some enemies in one hit</p>
		<pre>[To hit <a href = "#fist">Fist</a> roll of 20 or greater]</pre>
		<h4>4: Special melee attack</h4>
		<p>player performs an action such as: Push, knockdown, pull Etc.<p>
		<pre>[To hit <a href = "#fist">Fist</a> roll of 15 or greater]</pre>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Other:</h3>
		<h4>Grenades can be thrown 20 units + (FIST * 5). (This has a minimum of 20 units)</h4>
		<pre>[To hit <a href = "#fist">Fist</a> roll of 20 or greater]</pre>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Enemy Combat:</h3> 
		<p>When a group of enemy soldiers attack, instead of rolling per each individual soldier. The GC rolls a 1d20 + number of attackers - 1 (for a maximum of +10). The idea being to speed up enemies combat turn.</p>
		<p>A player-soldier starts with a hit score of 15. When an enemy soldier shoots, this is the amount the enemy soldiers need to meet to hit the player. This can be changed via powers. Standard armour does not change hit score.<p>
		<p>If the enemy hits its target, then the GC rolls 1d12 to determine where the bullet landed. (below):

	<section id = 'armor'><div class = well>
		<h2><strong>-Armour-</strong></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Armour absorbs damage before it hits the player but breaks down slowly. For example lets say a player has 15 armour and is shot with a 20 bullet. the armour reduces the bullet to only 5 damage but the armour itself is also damaged and now is 14 armour.</p>
		<p>However, some attacks may ignore armour and hit the HP directly such as armour piercing rounds or specific called shots that hit weak points in the armour. The exact functionality of armour is left up to GC. for example you could have a full body shield that only has 1 armour and reduces all damage to zero. Said armour could recharges every other turn; forcing attacks to be made in quick succession.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Cover:</strong> Cover is different than armour, instead of reducing the damage done, cover makes the role harder, so if an enemy needs a 15 to hit but they're in -5 cover, the player subtracts his roll by 5 so if they roll a 16 then subtract cover the attack misses. same goes for the enemies attack role if the player is in cover. if someone is in full cover they cannot be targeted with a normal attack. <strong>Players must spend one action to enter cover.</strong> they may spend an additional action to take 'full cover' when in full cover they cannot be targeted, but must also leave full cover for free to make an attack themselves.</p>

		<h2><strong>-Shooting Mechanics-</strong></h2>
		<h4>When shooting the player-soldier names the type of shot then rolls a D20 + FIST + Specialist mod (If they have it for the weapon). If the attack is successful and an aimed/steadied shot, the player then names a target (head,body,limb) and rolls 2D6s to see if they hit (chart below).

		<p><b>example:</b> The shot missed. The player rolls a [1d8] and gets a 1 for the direction then rolls a [1d6] and get a 5 for the distance. The shot then lands 5 spaces up, (a distance of 25 units) above of the original target.</p>
